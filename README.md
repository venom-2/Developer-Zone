# DeveloperZone - An Open-Source Event

Welcome to the Developer-Zone Open-Source Event! This GitHub repository serves as the central hub for managing the code submissions from various teams participating in the event. Each team is expected to push their code by compiling it in a folder with the name of their team. This readme file will guide you through the repository and explain the submission process.

## Repository Structure

The repository has the following structure:

- `/teams`
  - This is the root directory where each team will create a folder with their team name.
